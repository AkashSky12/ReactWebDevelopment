//CSS Flexbox
Flexbox is basically used for designing creative layouts
- In flexbox it's mainly wrap the div's inside a container and target those containers in CSS by adding display: flex;

NOTE: div has default block display, span has default inline display

//Fex direction:
By default the flex direction is set to row, because the data is added in the row(next to an item)
Main-axis: it is from left to right
Cross-axis: it is from top to bottom
Ex: #pond {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; //row/column/row-reverse/column-reverse
}

//Flex-Basis: if flex basic is set to 100px, then every div will expand 100px along the main axis

//Flex-wrap: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to 
wrap as needed with this property.
Ex: .container {
    flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
  }
- By default all the elements order value will be set to 0, they are arranged in ascending order as the values are set
1. Nowrap: if it set to 'nowrap' then new elements added will be added at the end and once it reaches the max width the new
  data will not go to new line. It'll continue in the same row.  
Ex: .container {
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
  }   

2. Wrap: if it set to 'nowrap' then new elements added will be added at the end and once it reaches the max width the new
data will go to new line and fit the 

3. Wrap-reverse: elements are wrapped but when website is scaled down thens elements go from bottom right corner to
top left corner.
Ex: .container {
    flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
  }       

//Justify-Content:
1. Flex-start: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the left
Ex: .container {
    justify-content: flex-start;
}
  
2. Flex-end: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the right
Ex: .container {
    justify-content: flex-end;
}

3. Center: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the center 
Ex: .container {
    justify-content: center;
}

4. Space-between/space-around/space-evenly: when this is used the elements will be bunched up with spaces covering the website
Ex:  .container {
    justify-content: space-between/space-around/space-evenly;
}

//Align-Items: It sets the height of the container. For this the flex-wrap should be set to 'nowrap'
1. Flex-start: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the top
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  align-items: flex-start;
  height: 70vh; // sets the height of the container
} 

2. Flex-end: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the bottom
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  align-items: flex-end;
  height: 70vh; // sets the height of the container (vh- viewport height)
} 

3. Center: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the center
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  align-items: center;
  height: 70vh; // sets the height of the container
} 

4. Baseline: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the top with gap
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  align-items: baseline;
} 

5. Stretch: when this is used the elements will be bunched up to the top and stretched till bottom
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  align-items: Stretch;
} 

//Align-Self: if we need only one element on top and others on different alignment
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  align-items: center;
}
  .violet {
    align-self: flex-start;
  }

//Align-content: to set align-content we need to first make the flex-wrap: wrap;. It works similar to the align-items.
It adjusts the elements accordingly once website is scaled down and takes the elements to new line.
Ex: .container {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: center;
}            

//flex-flow
This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex containerâ€™s
main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.  
Ex: .container {
    flex-flow: column wrap;
  }

//Flex-sizing: shrinking and growing the flexbox.
- Flexbox by default max-width looks at the longest possible line of the text, whereas the min-width looks at the longest
word to determine the minimum width.
- The hierarchy starts from 1. content-width, 2. width, 3. Flex-basis. 4. min-width/max-width. '4' has the highest priority
- If Flex-basis is less than max-width then it is considered. Whereas if the min-width is larger than flex-basis then
min-width is only considered. And it is not gonna shrink beyond the min-width. By default flex-basis is set to auto, that
means it'll give more priority to items with more content. If we don't need flex-basis then set it to '0'.
- If we want the items in the page not to grow or shrink then,
Ex: .container {
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
- If the flex-grow is set to 1 then the items fill the webpage. 
Ex: .container {
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
- If the flex-shrink is set to 1 then it's gonna adjust to the minimum width of the content.
Ex: .container {
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 1;
}

* There is also a short way of writing the flex-basis
Ex: flex: 1 1 0; //the first value is 'grow', second is 'shrink', and the third is 'basis'
