//Assume if same h1 is using multiple CSS. How would you differentiate them? Cascading from CSS comes into play
- Ex: HTML:
  <ol>
    <li>One</li>
    <li style="color: red;">Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
  </ol>
CSS:
li{
    color: green;
}
- The hierarchy goes from, 1. External, 2. Inline. So the inline overwrites the external CSS
* 4 importance of CSS rule: 1. Important, 2. Type, 3. Specificity, 4. Position
1. Position: check whether if a rule is at higher or lower position in CSS relative to other rules
Ex: 
li{ //for this li, blue will be the output
    color: red;
    color: blue;
}
li{ //for this entire program, green will the output. The hierarchy goes as they are overwritten
color: green;
}
2. Specificity: The order is 1. id, 2. Attribute, 3. Class, 4. Element are hierarchy
Ex: HTML:
    <li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable></li> 
    CSS:
    li{color: blue;}
    .first-class {color: red;}
    li[draggable] {color: red;} //The attribute will override the class
    #first-id {color: orange;}
3. Type: 1. Inline, 2. Internal, 3. External is the hierarchy. The 'Inline' is given highest priority and will override
Ex: HTML:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css"> //External
    <style></style>     //Internal
    <h1 style=" ">Hello</h1>      //Inline
4. Importance: to make the rule mandatory or override everything we can use '!important'
Ex: 
   color: red;
   color: blue !important;  //This overrides all the other rules
   
*Combining CSS
- To set some element rule within a div without affecting other elements is by using class descendants 
Ex:HTML:
   <p>Yellow Text</p>
   <div class="box inner-box">
    <p>White Text</p>   //To change only this 'p' tag property, we can use the below CSS
   </div> 
   CSS:
   p {
    color: yellow;
   }
   .inner-box p {
    color: purple;
   }

1. Group combination: group the tag and apply CSS  
Syntax: selector1, selector2... {  //you can add more selectors
        color: red;
        }

2. Child combination: traverse from parent to child and apply CSS(div inside an div). It applies only for direct child.
Syntax: selector1(Parent) > selector2(child) {
        color: firebrick;
        }        

3. Descendant combination: traverse from the ancestor to descendant
Syntax: selector1(ancestor) selector2(descendant) {
        color:blue;
        }        
   
4. Chaining combination: apply this combination where all the selectors are true. To add properties on specific tag.
Syntax: selector1selector2 {
        color: seagreen;
        }       

5. Combining combination: This method combines the any of 2 above combinations.
Syntax: Combination of descendant and chaining selector combinations
        selector1(ancestor) selector2selector3 {
            font-size: 2rem;
        }    
        
//CSS Position:
1. Static: HTML default flow. If set static no positioning happens in any direction, stays in default location. 
Ex: position: static; //in this the left and top is not considered 
    left: 50px;
    top: 50px;        
2. Relative: It set to relative then the box can be set to relative position in any directions.
Ex: position: relative;  //in this the box moves left 50px and top 50px relatively
    left: 50px;
    top: 50px;      
3. Absolute: it makes the positioning relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top-left corner of the webpage.
   NOTE: If we need to set the descendant position to relative, we need to set the ancestor also to relative.     
Ex: position: absolute;  //in this the box moves left 50px and top 50px absolutely 
    left: 50px;
    top: 50px;
4. Fixed: it makes the positioning relative to the top-left corner of the browser window. Even if page is scrolled it doesn't move.  
Ex: position: fixed;  //in this the box moves left 50px and top 50px from the browser top-left corner
    left: 50px;
    top: 50px;      
NOTE: Z-index: it determines which element should go on top of the other in z-axis
Ex: The absolute div will be on top of all other div, to move it to the back we can use the below
    div {
        position: absolute;
        z-index: -1;    
    }

NOTE: to create a circle in CSS 
Ex: .circle {
    background-color: red;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    }
