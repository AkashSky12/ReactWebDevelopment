//CSS Display
//SPAM: We can display a word separately with style in paragraph. Using SPAM tag and display property in CSS.
- There are 3 types of 'display' property.
1. Inline value: if the elements are set to inline. Then words go in the same line until end of the webpage, then 
new line. We cannot set the height and width of inline elements.
Ex: HTML:
<h3>Akash</h3>
<h3>Simon</h3>
In CSS:
h3 {
    display: inline; //it displays on same line without the second word going to new line. O/P: Akash Simon in 1 line 
}

2. Block value: if the element is set to block. Then it'll take up the entire full with of the webpage for a word. 
 And new line for another word.
Ex: HTML:
<h3>Akash</h3>
<h3>Simon</h3>
In CSS:
h3 {
    display: block;
}

3. Inline-Block: if the element is set to this. Then we can set height and width also multiple elements can go in the same line.

4. None: if the element is set to this. Then it makes the element disappear.

//Float: if we want to wrap our text around another element. Like a newspaper image and text around that fits in box.
Ex: HTML:
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>text.....</p>
    CSS:
    img {
      float: left;  //images goes to left and automatically text is wrapped to the right
    }

//Clear: it clears any responsibility to wrap around things that are floating.
Ex: HTML: 
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>text...</p>
    <footer>Copyright.....</footer>
    CSS:
    img {
        float: right:
    }
    footer {
        clear: left; //this means the footer is clear from left float and it goes to its normal position ignoring float.
    }

//Responsive Website: making websites look good on all screen sizes. i.e, making website fit on all the screen sizes
1. Media Queries:
Ex: @media (max-width: 600px) {
    //CSS for screens below or equal to 600px wide
} 
2. CSS Grid: used for creating 2D layouts
Ex: HTML:
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="first card"></div>
      <div class="card"></div>
      <div class="card"></div>
      <div class="card"></div>
      <div class="card"></div>
    </div>
    CSS:
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 100px 200px 200px;
        gap: 30px;
    }
    .first {
        grid-column: span 2;
    }
    .card {
        background-color: blue;
    }
3. CSS Flexbox: used for creating 1D layouts. For creating boxes with different/same sizes horizontally or vertically in website.
Ex: HTML:
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="first card"></div>
      <div class="second card"></div>
      <div class="card"></div>
      <div class="card"></div>
    </div>
    CSS:
    .flex-container {
        display: flex;
    }
    .card {
        background: blue;
        border: 30px solid white;
        height: 100px;
        flex: 1;
    }
    .first {
        flex: 2;
    }
    .second {
        flex: 0.5;
    }
4. External framework(Bootstrap): it is a framework created using Flexbox. It divides the website to 12 sections 
Ex: <div class="container"></div>
      <div class="row"></div>
        <div class="card col-6"></div>
        Card
        </div>
        <div class="card col-2"></div>
        Card
        </div>
        <div class="card col-4"></div>
        Card
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
1. Media Queries: 
Syntax: @media (max-width: 600px) { //anything within the bracket is called breakpoint, anything given within the range
    h1 {                              will be using the below CSS design.
        font-size: 15px;
    }
}    
a. Combine:
Syntax: @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 900px) { //min is for the right side of the screen and max for left side
    /*Styles for screens between 600px and 900px*/
}
Syntax: @media (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 900px) { 
    /*Styles for screens less than 600px and greater than 900px*/
}

b. Device: 
Syntax: @media screen (orientation: landscape) {
    /*Styles for landscape orientation*/
}
//instead of screen print is also there which means target media query whenever the website is printed and to give it a
  different layout.
