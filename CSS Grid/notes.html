CSS Grid:
- CSS grid is basically used for 2D layouts, with table structure of columns and rows
Grid vs Flexbox reference: https://appbrewery.github.io/grid-vs-flexbox/
- When the layout is set to grid and the screen is made smaller the items get lined up to each other in column and row 
 basis, also making a grid structure. Whereas the flexbox does not have the same behavior.
//How to create a grid structure
HTML:
<div class="container">
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
</div>  
CSS:
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; //fr: fraction. This means second box twice the size of the first box
    grid-template-row: 1fr 1fr; //number of rows ro create
    gap: 10px;
}

//Grid sizing:
Ex: HTML:
<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">1</div>
    <div class="grid-item">2</div>
    <div class="grid-item">3</div>
    <div class="grid-item">4</div>
</div>
CSS: 
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
    grid-template-row: 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 10px;
}
- Template rows/columns can be created using fr, px, rem, grid-template
- Grid created using px/rem are not responsive. i,e. if we change the width and height of screen, then grid doesn't change
- Other way to represent grid-template-row/column:
Ex: grid-template: 100px 200px / 400px 800px; //first part defined is rows and the second is column
- We can use auto to setup the grid:
Ex: 
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px auto; //setting column auto takes up 100% width of webpage
    grid-template-row: 100px auto; //setting row auto makes sure that the space is set for content to fit
}
