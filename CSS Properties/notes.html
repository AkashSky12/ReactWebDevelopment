//Font properties
1. Font size
 - Pixel(px): 1 pixel is 1/96th inch or 0.26mm in square
 - Point(pt): 1 point is 1/72nd inch or 0.35mm in square
 - em: em depends 100% on the parent tag changes. Ex: font of a tag is 20em and parent is 2px then em is calculated as 2x20=40px
 - rem: rem depends 100% on the root(html) tag changes. Ex: font of a tag is 20rem and root is 2px then rem is calculated as 2x20=40px
 2. Font weight
 - Normal
 - Bold
 - We can create font relative to parent
 - We can also use numbers(100-900). Lighter means -100 and bolder +100
3. Font Family: what font you want the text to look like
Ex: font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif. Helvetica is called the typeface, and the sans is the generic font backup as fonts
 will be missing in systems. If font name has spaces the use the double quotes. Ex: "Times New Roman"
Best website to find fonts: https://fonts.google.com/

//Test Align
Ex: text-align: center; Also. justify, start, end, right, left

//The Box Model(Margin, Padding, Border): Everything in HTML is represented in box shape
Margin, Padding, Border, along with height and width form a CSS box model
- Width and height can be represented by px or percentage(%)
Ex: height: 300px; width: 300%;
- Border should be represented by first the border thickness, second is style of border and third is color. It does not change the the size of the inner box.
Ex: border: 12px solid black;
    border-top: 0px; //if declared only once then all sides will be effected
    border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px; //(0px-top, 10-right, 20-bottom, 30-left, goes in clockwise direction)
    border-width: 10px 20px; //(top+bottom = 10px, right+left = 20px)
- Padding: it adds space between the inner box and the border, without changing the size of the inner box.
Ex: padding: 12px;    
- Margin: it adds space outside the border.
Ex: margin: 3px
- Padding, margin and border-width all 3 functions the same as the border-width example
// To create a box we need to use the content division element. i,e <div></div>
- Since the <div> is invisible it is sometimes difficult to debug, use the extension 'Pesticide chrome extension' to get rid of bugs in CSS
